# Netflix Clone

This repository contains a [Netflix clone](https://netflix.luckyprima.site) project, built to replicate the user interface and some core functionalities of the popular streaming platform. This project leverages the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API** to fetch movie and TV show data, providing a dynamic and rich content experience.

## üöÄ Overview

This Netflix Clone aims to deliver a familiar and engaging streaming experience. By integrating with the TMDB API, it offers a wide range of movies and TV shows, complete with details, posters, and potentially trailers (depending on implementation).

## ‚ú® Features

While specific features can be expanded upon, this project typically includes:

- **Dynamic Content Loading:** Fetches and displays movie and TV show data directly from the TMDB API.
- **Categorized Browse:** Content organized into various categories (e.g., trending, top-rated, genres).
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a seamless viewing experience across different devices.
- **Visual Appeal:** Mimics the iconic Netflix UI for a familiar look and feel.
- **Movie/TV Show Details:** Displaying information such as title, overview, and poster images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Based on common practices for such projects, this clone likely uses:

- **Frontend Framework/Library:** React js
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** For application logic.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **TMDB API:** For fetching movie and TV show data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (if using a JavaScript frontend framework like React, Vue, or Angular)
- A **TMDB API Key**:
  1.  Go to [TMDB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an account.
  2.  Navigate to your account settings and generate an API key (usually under the API section).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LuckyPrima/Netflix-Clone.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Netflix-Clone
    ```
3.  Install dependencies (if applicable, for frontend frameworks):
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Configure API Key**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
    - Add your TMDB API key to this file. The variable name might vary depending on your setup (e.g., `REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY`, `VUE_APP_TMDB_API_KEY`, or `TMDB_API_KEY`).
      ```
      # Example for React
      REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE
      ```
      _Replace `YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key._

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

(The specific command might vary based on your chosen frontend framework. For example, it could be `npm run dev` or `yarn serve`).

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated by your development server) to see the Netflix Clone in action.
